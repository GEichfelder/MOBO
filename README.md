# MOBO - Multi-objective Bilevel Optimization Solver

## Introduction

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of algorithms for solving multiobjective optimization problems. The implementation was realized by Leo Warnow as work for Gabriele Eichfelder at TU Ilmenau (Institute for Mathematics).

You can start using the algorithms easily by downloading or cloning this repository using the green button near the top of the GitHub page. It is highly recommended to read the Documentation file first. It will guide you through the basic usage of the algorithms and shows you how to provide your own problems. It also contains a walkthrough for some demo files. In this way you can easily get used to working with the algorithm.
